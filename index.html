            <li>  UFO Run is a fun game because it's very easy to learn how to play, and is simple as it only involves one control, the spacebar. The graphics are very nice and friendly. What's nice is that instead of the character dying upon first impact (like other similar games that I have played) the player is given a certain amount of hit points. That way you can have multiple collisions before you die. The only thing I don't like about the game is that the difficulty increases very quickly, so play time decreases.

      <li>I like the concept of the game. You have to maneuver around obstacles without separating the three mice. I find the game extremely difficult to play, and a bit taxing as it's difficult to complete the level (I haven't completed it even once).<br><br>
